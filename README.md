# OpenCVMousePointer

using openCV for accessbility.



## Mouse

to use the mouse, close all your fingers except the index finger. to click, extend out your thumb. Note that there is a 1-second delay before you can click again to avoid spam clicking

## Keyboard

you can cycle through different windows (cntrl+right or left). extend all fingers and swipe right or left respectively. Also has a 1-second delay



Also, I spent way too long only to figure out that 
1) mediapipe isn't yet supported for python 3.12
2) mediapipe 0.10.10 itself had some semantic differences from 99% of people online trying to teach this
